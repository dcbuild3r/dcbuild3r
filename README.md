## Hello there, I'm [dcbuilder.eth](https://twitter.com/DCbuild3r).

I am currently a research engineer at [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/).

My meta-goal is to maximize the positive impact I have on the world to help people and take humanity to a new age of prosperity and abundance.

After a few years of trying out different things I decided that crypto and web3 were the best tools for me to accomplish this.

- üíª I do research in Cryptography (ZK*), Ethereum, L2 scaling solutions, MEV and more!
- ‚úçÔ∏è I'm writing a blockchain development guide as a public good, stay tuned ([devpill.me](http://devpill.me/) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devpillme))
- üî• I have a passion for web3, AI, mathematics, physics and more.
