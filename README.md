## Hello there, I'm [dcbuilder.eth](https://twitter.com/DCbuild3r).

I am currently a research engineer at [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/). I am currently learning about ZKML and creating a [zero-knowledge circuit for a convolutional neural network](https://github.com/dcbuild3r/proto-neural-zkp/) using Rust and the [Plonky2](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2) proving system.

My meta-goal is to maximize the positive impact I have on the world to help people and take humanity to a new age of prosperity and abundance.

After a few years of trying out different things I decided that crypto and web3 were the best tools for me to accomplish this.

- üíª I do research in Cryptography (ZK*), Ethereum, L2 scaling solutions, MEV and more!
- ‚úçÔ∏è I'm writing a blockchain development guide as a public good, stay tuned ([devpill.me](http://devpill.me/) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devpillme))
- üî• I have a passion for web3, AI, mathematics, physics and more.
- üéì I'm currently advising two blockchain development bootcamps on how to structure their curriculums for maximum learning, striking partnerships, sourcing mentors/TAs, etc.√ü

### Blockchain Development (EVM)

- Solidity
- Ethers.js
