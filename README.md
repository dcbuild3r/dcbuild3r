## Hello there, I'm [dcbuilder.eth](https://twitter.com/DCbuild3r).

I am a research engineer at the [Worldcoin Foundation](https://worldcoin.org/).

My meta-goal is to maximize the positive impact I have on the world to help people and take humanity to a new age of prosperity and abundance.

After a few years of trying out different things, I decided that crypto and web3 were the best tools for me to accomplish this.

- ðŸ’» I do research and engineering in Programmable Cryptography (ZK*), digital identity, Ethereum, and more!
- ðŸ“š I am currently learning abstract algebra, cryptography, and ZK. 
- ðŸ”¥ I have a passion for web3, AI, mathematics, physics and more.
